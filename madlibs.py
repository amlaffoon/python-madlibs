#American Psycho opening monologue

madlib = f"I live in the American Gardens Building on West 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is {name}. \
I'm {age} years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced {noun1} and a {adj1} exercise routine. \
In the morning, if my face is a little {adj2}, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my {noun2} crunches. \
I can do {num} now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. \
In the shower I use a {noun3} activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face a(n) {adj3} gel scrub. \
Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I {verb1} the rest of my routine. \
I always {verb2} an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. \
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. \
There is an idea of a {name}. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. \
Something illusory. And though I can hide my {adj4} gaze, and you can {verb3} my hand and feel {noun4} gripping yours, \
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I {adverb} am not there."
